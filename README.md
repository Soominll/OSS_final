*Welcome to Soo Min's Github space!*

This is for OSS project using raspberry pi.

1. Name of the project: Twitter bot
2. Role: The bot helps tweeting updated information scraped from Hisnet regularly.
3. Usefulness: Students or any faculty of HGU can get access to updated Hisnet announments very easily without logging into the Hisnet site using Twitter.
4. You can visit my twitter page to see the result.
5. If you want to implement your own twitter bot, you can create a twitter application -> download proper environment -> write python code (you can reference my code) -> run!

If you have any question, please contact me.
